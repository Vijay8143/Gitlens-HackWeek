## 📝 Observations

Using GitLens in VS Code made it simple to identify the origin and history of this test function. The inline blame clearly showed who authored the line, and hovering over it displayed the commit message, author, and timestamp. The GitLens sidebar also provided access to full file and line history.

This tool is incredibly useful for understanding legacy code and contribution timelines in open-source projects.
